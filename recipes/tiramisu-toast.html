    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I was really craving tiramisu, but I didn't want to make an entire pan, so what I attempted to do was create a toast-based, individual-sized portion using the same key components.</p>
    <p>While this wasn't quite tiramisu, this much faster, simpler, easier method was incredible.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Toast:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons strongly brewed espresso</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 (1 inch thick) slices day-old Italian bread</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>For the Mascarpone Topping:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons dry Marsala wine</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup mascarpone cheese</li>
      <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.</li>
      <li>Crack egg into a baking dish. Add white sugar, espresso, and vanilla extract. Whisk to combine. Place bread slices into the dish and toss in the mixture to saturate; let sit for 10 to 15 minutes to fully absorb.</li>
      <li>Transfer bread slices to the prepared pan and drizzle any accumulated coffee mixture liquid over top.</li>
      <li>Bake toast in the center of the preheated oven until custard is cooked and bread bounces back slightly when touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer slices to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, pour wine into a saucepan. Add sugar and cook over medium heat until reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
      <li>Place mascarpone cheese into a bowl and add cooled wine reduction and a very small pinch of salt. Stir with a spatula until combined. Chill before piping or spreading on cooled toast. Top with shaved chocolate.</li>
    </ol>
